<h1>Order of operations</h1>
<p>In computing, as in math, multiplication and division<br>
    are performed before addition and subtraction.</p>
    <p>So 3 + 5 * 0 is 3 not 0 as since 5 * 0 is performed first.<br>
        A lot of people don't understand this</p>
        <p>But code within parentheses is performed first,<br>
            which a lot of people do understand </p>
<p>So when mixing multiplication and division with addition and subtraction,<br>
    it's good form to use parenthesis, and not to rely on anyone reading your code to understand order of operations</p>
<p>So code 3 + 5 * 0 as 3 + (5 * 0), if you want the normal order of operations. They are both the same, but the latter is more understandable</p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Calculate <b>tip and split</b></p>
<p>Prompt for:
    <ul>
        <li><b>cost of meal</b></li>
        <li><b>tip percent</b> you want tp leave</li>
        <li><b>the number of people</b> in your party</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculate<p>
<ul>
    <li><b>tip amount</b></li>
    <li><b>how much each person pays</b><br>
    (assume you split the bill equally)</li>

</ul>
