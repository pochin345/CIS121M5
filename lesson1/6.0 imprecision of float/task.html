<h1>Imprecision of float</h1>
<p>Trying to represent a number with a decimal point<br>
as a binary number results in imprecise numbers.</p>
<p>For example. suppose I were try to multiply 1.3 by 1.3<br>
In decimal that would result in 1.69<br>
Not so as this simple exercise will show you.</p>
<p>Enter 1.3 at the prompt<br>
    the program multiplies the number by itself<br>
you get 1.6900000000000002 when not rounded<br>
1.69 when rounded</p>
<p>If you want to know why,
    <a href="https://timothybramlett.com/floating-point-imprecision.html#:~:text=What%20is%20floating%20point%20imprecision,have%20trouble%20storing%20the%20number%20. ">

<p>We're more interested in how to fix it:</p>
<h2>round()</h2>
<p>The <b>round</b> function:</p>
<ul>
    <li>fixes the imprecision of the <b>float</b> type</li>
    <li>rounds the number to a specified number of decimal places<br>
    typically 2, if you're working with currency</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Enter various numbers, and notice the difference<br>
    between not rounded and rounded numbers<br>
    when the number is multiplied by itself.
